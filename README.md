# Karaconf

This is a tool for writing the configuration file (`$HOME/.config/karabiner/karabiner.json`) for [Karabiner-Elements](https://karabiner-elements.pqrs.org/) in Rust.

Managing the numerous Karabiner settings by directly editing `karabiner.json` is cumbersome, so I created a tool to generate and update the configuration in Rust.
